/* Crash-safe ping-pong savestate persistence (build-order items #4 + #5).

 * Storage goes through the port's platform_savestate_* slot backend (file-backed on
 * desktop, flash on embedded). Two ping-pong SLOTS each carry a monotonically
 * increasing sequence number and a CRC-32 over their payload:
 *   - save_slots() serializes the live state to the slot that is NOT the current
 *     newest-valid one, so a power-loss mid-write leaves the prior slot intact (the
 *     commit is atomic via the sequence number).
 *   - load_slots() validates (CRC) the newest slot and applies it, falling back to
 *     the older slot if the newest is torn. It validates BEFORE touching any live
 *     state, so a corrupt slot never partially overwrites the running game.
 *
 * Both MUST be called at a root-loop boundary (host_root_boundary), never mid-pump, 
 * since load replaces the mode stack wholesale. load_slots() returns false only when
 * NEITHER slot is valid. */

 * Catches a section that is written but not restored on load, the failure the plain
