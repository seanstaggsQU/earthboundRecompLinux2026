 *   - Coffee/tea break text sequences
 *   - Ending text
 *
 * The system uses its own VWF buffer separate from the window system. */

 * word-wrap off) and returns the GAME_MODE_FLYOVER (FO_SCRIPT) init scalars;
 * false = bad id / missing asset (no flyover; a missing asset leaves entity
 * 23 disabled, matching the original early-return). The interpreter itself
 * runs as GAME_MODE_FLYOVER, pushed by GAME_MODE_ACTIONSCRIPT_FRAME for its
