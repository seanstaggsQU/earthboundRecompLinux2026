 * suspended mid-C-stack inside a synchronous blocking helper. So a capture request
 * does NOT snapshot immediately: it sets a pending flag, host_process_frame() then
 * free-runs (skips render + vblank pacing but keeps the per-frame logic running) so
 * any finite blocking helper unwinds to the root in CPU time, and host_root_boundary()
 *, called only from the outermost loop, performs the actual capture. An indefinite
 * input-wait (e.g. display_text at a "▼" prompt) never unwinds; the unwind is capped
 * and a capture failure is logged rather than writing a torn snapshot. This is the
 * `g_shutdown_requested` mechanism the embedded power-off handler will reuse. */
